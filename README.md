## Introduction

`foamalgo` is a head-only C++ (17) library with Python binding `pyfoamalgo`, 
which is meant to be used in numerical analysis in photon science and 
accelerator physics. It leverages SIMD and multi-threaded parallelism
to increase algorithm performance by up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to 
the implementations in other libraries like [numpy](https://numpy.org/).

`foamalgo` has been developed based on the algorithm package in [EXtra-foam](https://github.com/European-XFEL/EXtra-foam),
which is the framework for real-time (online) data analysis and visualization 
of big data from various large detectors at European XFEL and has stood 
the test of 24/7 operations. By separating the algorithm code in a 
stand-alone library, it facilitates the maintanance of the large code base
and benefits the offline analysis as well.
